# Arithmetic-Calculator-Using-Racket

Here we have tried to build a simple text based arithmetic calculator using Racket Language which takes expressions in their prefix format for evaluation.

## The racket file consists of

-  Splitting the text into strings using split-string function
-  Sending the operands in the expressions to apply-op function using exec function
-  Performing arithmetic operations using apply-op function.
